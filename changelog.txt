------------------------
version 4 (06-12-2013)
------------------------
- Added Context Menu (can be disabled simply by unbinding it).
- Reset Image (default: R) now centers the image on the monitor it's currently on (or in the top-left it's a large/wide image).
- Faster Animated Gif Loading - the loading of the frames are now done in seperate threads allowing for animated gifs to display much sooner.
- Image Preloading - when using the next/prev image buttons the image after the one just loaded is preloaded ready (can be turned off).
- Limited the amount of images and animations that can be stored in memory (to avoid the program using too much memory). Up to 20 images and 6 animated gifs stay in memory when navigating with the next/prev image buttons.
- All control bindings should now be bindable to either or both mouse buttons and keyboard keys.
- Fixed bug where Animated Gifs reloaded themselves even though they were still in memory.
- Fixed crash when navigating images in a folder that contained files with names with very large numbers in them.

------------------------
version 3 (22-11-2013)
------------------------
- Improved Animated GIF Support - if an animated gif looked glitchy before, it should be fine now.
- Added image name to the window title.
- Added Natural Sorting (ie: navigating through numbered images used to go like this: z1->z10->z11, now they go like this z1->z2->z3..z10->z11)
- Press R to reset the image's scale and rotation and un-flip it.
- When navigating through images the window now stays centered on it's position.
- JPGs that have an orientation value set in their EXIF information now start off at that rotation.
- Fixed the window jumping around if the user spams next/prev image.
- Zooming now scales based on the center of the image (hold CTRL to scale based off top-left)
- Zooming now has a maximum (prevents the program from crashing at ridiculous sizes).
- Zooming or changing image now stops dragging.

------------------------
version 2 (17-11-2013)
------------------------
- Press L (default) to toggle Always On Top mode.
- Fit to monitor height now temporary sets Always On Top mode.
- Holding SHIFT (default) while setting Fit To Monitor Height (Middle Mouse Button (default)) sets the image to the height of the working area (ie: the height of the screen minus the task bar height).
- When an image is opened at the Mouse Position it will snap to the edges of the working area of the monitor it was opened on instead of hanging off the edges of the screen.
